
Introduction to MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database used for storing data in flexible, JSON-like format. It offers scalability, high performance, and ease of development for applications.

What is MongoDB Compass?
MongoDB Compass is the official graphical user interface (GUI) for MongoDB. It helps users visualize and manage their MongoDB data, allowing them to query, explore, and analyze data with ease.

What is MongoDB Playground?
MongoDB Playground is an interactive environment within MongoDB Compass that allows developers to write, test, and execute MongoDB queries. It enables a smooth workflow for experimenting with MongoDB queries.

What is a Collection in MongoDB?
A collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of a table in relational databases, where documents (data records) are stored. Collections do not enforce a schema, allowing documents to have varying fields.

What is a Database in MongoDB?
A database is a container for collections in MongoDB. Each MongoDB instance can contain multiple databases. A database stores all of the collections and can be used to organize different applications' data.

What is an Array Object in MongoDB?
An array in MongoDB is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single field. Array objects can hold various data types, including strings, numbers, and even other documents, enabling complex data relationships.
